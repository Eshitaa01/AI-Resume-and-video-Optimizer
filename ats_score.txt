**ATS Compatibility Score:** 35/100

**Matched Keywords:**  HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Web Development, Software Engineer,  Software Engineering, Coding, Testing, Communication, Team Management

**Suggestion:** This resume needs significant improvement to be ATS-friendly.  The current format is visually appealing but lacks the structured keyword density needed for ATS systems.  The candidate should:

1. **Rewrite the summary:**  Instead of general statements, use keywords and quantify achievements.  For example, instead of "Passionate about software development," write "Developed three web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, demonstrating proficiency in front-end development and basic back-end concepts."

2. **Quantify achievements:**  For each project, include specific quantifiable results.  E.g., "Improved website load time by 15% by optimizing images and code."  "Reduced bug count by 20% through rigorous testing."

3. **Use a standard resume format:**  Employ a clear, structured format with dedicated sections for skills, projects, and experience, emphasizing keywords from job descriptions.  Avoid creative formatting that can confuse ATS.

4. **Expand technical skills section:**  Include more specific technologies and frameworks relevant to software engineering roles.  The current list is too basic.

5. **Add relevant certifications:** If any certifications relate to software engineering (e.g., specific programming languages or frameworks), list them prominently.

6. **Address missing keywords:** Incorporate missing keywords naturally within the resume content, rather than simply listing them.  The goal is to demonstrate the skills, not just list them.


By focusing on a keyword-rich, results-oriented, and structured resume, the candidate will significantly improve their chances of passing through an ATS and getting their application reviewed by a human recruiter.
